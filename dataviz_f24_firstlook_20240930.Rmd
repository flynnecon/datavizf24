##Loading the data
There are packages for loading data. Our data will either be an Excel file or a comma-separated values (.csv) file.

```{r}
urlfile="https://https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flynnecon/datavizf24/refs/heads/main/online_monthly_R.csv"
```
#Getting the data read into R and then made into our time series analysis format. Note we do not need a training or test data division with the fact we are looking at a forecast 1 period ahead.
```{r  data work}
data <- read_csv(url(urlfile))
```
```{r scatter}
data |> ggplot(x=Month,y=Handle) + geom_point()
```
