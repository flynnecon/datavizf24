# Creating a Slope Chart in R


```{r load the libraries}
library(tidyverse)
library(tsibble)
urlfile="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/flynnecon/datavizf24/refs/heads/main/Slope%20Chart/us_auto_share.csv"
```



```{r read the data}
carshare <- read_csv(url(urlfile))
```
In this case you will want to check right away the the command **View(carshare)** to see what the data look like. The categorical aspect to the identifier and the irregular spacing of the data make it important to guarantee the data imported correctly.
